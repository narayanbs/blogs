### ✅ **Alacritty: What Happens When You Open a Text File**

Assuming:

* Locale: `en_US.UTF-8`
* Font: `Hack` (configured in `alacritty.yml`)
* File encoding: UTF-8

---

### ✔️ **Step-by-Step Flow (Corrected)**

1. **Locale (`en_US.UTF-8`) is used by the shell/terminal environment**:

   * The UTF-8 part tells the system (and Rust's I/O libraries) how to decode file content: `UTF-8 → Unicode code points`.

2. **Alacritty receives decoded Unicode text** (from shell, commands, or file output).

3. **Configured font is `Hack`**, which refers to a `.ttf` or `.otf` file (usually resolved via fontconfig or directly from system paths).

4. **For each Unicode code point** (e.g., `U+0041` for "A"):

   * Alacritty checks whether the **Hack font** contains a glyph for it.

5. **Alacritty uses FreeType**:

   * Loads `Hack.ttf` or `Hack.otf`
   * Asks FreeType to render the glyph (rasterize it into a bitmap or signed distance field).
   * No shaping is done (one-to-one mapping from Unicode to glyph).

6. **Rendered glyphs are sent to GPU via OpenGL/Vulkan** for display.

### 🔍 So, you are **correct**:

> Alacritty decodes the file using UTF-8 (based on the locale), then reads glyphs from Hack.ttf/otf, and sends them to FreeType for rendering.

✅ **Yes — that's accurate.**

🧠 Bonus: The font file (Hack.ttf or Hack.otf) contains the glyph outlines and mapping tables that allow FreeType to render each glyph corresponding to the Unicode code points.
