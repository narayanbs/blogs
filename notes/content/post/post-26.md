Yes, the linker combines the `.text` sections and `.data` sections from all the object files into a single `.text` or `.data` section in the final executable. However, it's important to understand how the linker handles these sections and relative addresses during the linking process. Let me break it down in more detail:

### 1. **Object Files and Sections:**
   - Each **object file** (.o file) typically contains one or more sections, such as `.text` (for code), `.data` (for initialized global and static variables), `.bss` (for uninitialized variables), etc.
   - Within these sections, the addresses of symbols (functions, variables, etc.) are usually represented as **relative addresses** or **offsets** within the section. These addresses are **not absolute**; they are **relative to the start of the section** or a specific symbol.

### 2. **Linking Process:**
   - **Linker** combines the sections from all object files into a final executable, typically with its own layout.
   - The linker will allocate space for each section in the final executable:
     - It will combine all `.text` sections from all object files into a single **.text** section.
     - Similarly, all `.data` sections are combined into a single **.data** section, and so on.
   
   During this process, the linker needs to handle **symbol addresses** and **relocations**.

### 3. **Handling Relative Addresses During Linking:**
   - The addresses in object files are **relative** to the start of the section in each object file, not absolute memory addresses.
   - When the linker combines the sections, it must adjust the **relative addresses** so they reflect the new position of the sections in the final executable. This means the linker will:
     - **Rebase the addresses** of functions and variables relative to the new start of the section in the combined executable.
     - Resolve any **symbol references** (e.g., function calls, variable accesses) by updating the relative addresses to point to the correct locations after the sections are merged.
   
   The linker does this by:
   - **Relocation**: The linker updates the symbol addresses by applying **relocation entries** that adjust relative offsets to new positions in the combined sections. For example, if a function `foo()` in an object file has a relative address of `0x10` within its `.text` section, and the `.text` section in the final executable starts at `0x1000`, the linker would update the address of `foo()` to `0x1010` (if the final position of the `.text` section in memory is at `0x1000`).

### 4. **Relocation Table:**
   - The object file has a **relocation table** that holds information about where and how addresses need to be modified during the linking process.
   - The relocation table tells the linker which parts of the code or data need to be modified when combining sections. For example, a function call in one object file might be using a relative address that needs to be updated based on the new position of the `.text` section in the final executable.

### 5. **Final Executable:**
   - After the linker has combined the sections, the executable is generated with all sections (e.g., `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`) properly laid out.
   - When the program is loaded into memory, the **loader** assigns a **base address** to the executable, and all addresses are adjusted relative to this base address. The **loader** then handles any final address adjustments (e.g., with ASLR) and resolves any remaining relocations.

### Example:
Imagine you have two object files:
1. **Object file 1**:
   - `.text` section: code for `main()`, starting at address `0x0` in the object file.
   - `.data` section: initialized variable `a`, starting at address `0x0` in the object file.

2. **Object file 2**:
   - `.text` section: code for `foo()`, starting at address `0x0` in the object file.
   - `.data` section: initialized variable `b`, starting at address `0x0` in the object file.

When linked:
- The `.text` sections from both object files will be combined into a single `.text` section.
- The linker will adjust the relative addresses in the code so that `main()` and `foo()` are placed at the correct locations in the final executable's `.text` section, taking into account the relative position of each section.
- Similarly, the `.data` sections will be combined, and the addresses of variables `a` and `b` will be adjusted in the final executable.

### Summary:
- In object files, addresses are **relative** (typically offsets within sections like `.text` or `.data`).
- The linker **combines** the sections from multiple object files into a single section in the executable, adjusting the relative addresses to reflect their new positions.
- The linker uses a **relocation process** to update these relative addresses and symbol references.
- The final executable has sections with **absolute addresses**, but these are the result of relocation, and the loader may further adjust addresses based on factors like ASLR.

Yes, it's entirely possible for two different executables in Linux to show the same entry point address when you check with `readelf`. Here's why that can happen:

### 1. **Entry Point in Executables:**
   - The **entry point** of an executable refers to the address in the program where execution begins. This is typically the **start of the `main()` function** or the initialization code in a program.
   - The entry point is stored in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) header and is typically specified by the **linker** when creating the executable. The linker sets this to the address of the `main()` function (or other program startup code, depending on the architecture and OS).

### 2. **Fixed Entry Point in Executables:**
   - **Before ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** was introduced, the entry point address was often fixed across executions or across different builds of the same program.
   - Even with ASLR, the **entry point address** in the ELF file's header does not changeâ€”it always points to the location of the program's entry function (e.g., `main()` or `_start`). ASLR only randomizes the **virtual address space** where the entire executable is loaded into memory when it's executed.

### 3. **Why You See the Same Entry Point Address:**
   - When you use a tool like `readelf` to examine the ELF headers of two different executables, you are looking at the **compiled entry point address** as stored in the executable's ELF header. This is not affected by ASLR or the actual memory location where the program is loaded during runtime.
   - **The entry point address in the ELF header** is a **fixed value** that refers to the location of the entry function in the program's compiled code. This value will be the same for both executables as long as:
     - Both executables were compiled from the same code and with similar settings (e.g., same linker scripts, compiler flags, etc.).
     - The **entry function's position in the program's code** is the same.

### 4. **ASLR and the Entry Point Address:**
   - **ASLR** affects the **virtual memory layout** of the process at runtime, including the **base address** of the program's sections (e.g., `.text`, `.data`), but it does not alter the entry point stored in the ELF header. 
   - For example, if two programs have the same entry point address in their ELF headers (say, both point to the same offset in the `.text` section), when the programs are loaded into memory:
     - The entry point will still **point to the same relative location** in the program's memory, but the absolute memory address of that entry point will be different due to ASLR.
     - In other words, **ASLR** randomizes where the program is loaded in memory, but the entry point will still be a consistent offset from the base address where the program starts in memory.

### 5. **Possible Explanations for Same Entry Point:**
   - If you compile two different executables that are based on the same source code, with the same compiler flags and linker settings, the **entry point** (in the ELF file) could be the same because the compiled code structure and location of the entry point function (`main()`, `_start`, etc.) will be identical.
   - Even with different source files or different configurations, if the entry point function is the same (i.e., both executables have the same `main()` function), the **compiled code's entry point** (the offset into the `.text` section) could be the same, resulting in the same entry point address.

### 6. **What You Are Seeing in `readelf`:**
   - When you run `readelf -h <executable>`, it shows the **entry point address** as stored in the ELF header. This address is **not affected by ASLR** or the runtime location of the executable in memory.
   - For two executables compiled from the same source code or using the same entry point, `readelf` will show the same entry point address.

### Key Points:
- The **entry point address** in the ELF header is the address of the entry function (e.g., `main()`, `_start`).
- ASLR affects where the executable is loaded in memory at runtime, but it does not alter the entry point address in the ELF header.
- Two executables compiled from the same source or with the same entry point will have the same entry point address in their ELF headers, even though they might be loaded at different memory addresses when executed.

### Conclusion:
The entry point address you see in `readelf` is consistent because it's pointing to the **same location in the compiled code**. ASLR will affect where the program is loaded in memory at runtime, but the entry point address in the ELF header remains fixed based on how the program is compiled.
